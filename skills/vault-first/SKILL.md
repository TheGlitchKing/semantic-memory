name: vault-first
description: Default mode skill for semantic-sidekick. Treats the markdown vault as present context, not retrievable-on-demand storage. Activates on any operational, architectural, or "how/why/where does this project…" question about the current project, product, or codebase — including prose questions like "how do we deploy", "what's our process for X", "why is Y structured this way", "where does Z live", "how does auth work here", "what are the conventions", operational runbook questions, and gotcha/known-issue lookups. Also activates when hooks have injected <vault-context> blocks into the conversation. Does NOT activate on pure code-symbol lookups ("where is function X defined" → Grep) or on research/evaluative questions about external tools ("is there a better X than Y" → semantic-first's research flow). Coexists with semantic-first — semantic-first handles routing between docs index + research vault; vault-first is the behavioral mode that actually uses them on every relevant prompt rather than waiting to be asked.

# vault-first

**Default mode.** The vault is present, not retrievable. Use it on every relevant prompt, cite what you find, and say it out loud when you didn't find anything.

## Why this skill exists

A 500-note vault that Claude only consults when explicitly asked is a liability — the knowledge creates false confidence ("we've documented that") while being silently bypassed. `semantic-first` routes lookups *when Claude decides to look*. `vault-first` is the decision layer: for any project-scoped prose question, Claude looks *by default*, before answering from memory or guessing.

This skill is one of three mode skills in the sidekick routing system (`vault-first`, `research-mode`, `outage-silence`). It is the default when none of the others apply.

## When you are in vault-first mode

You are in vault-first mode when:

- The user's question is about **this specific project, product, or codebase** and the answer would naturally live in a design doc, runbook, ADR, troubleshooting guide, or decision log.
- The user asks "how", "why", "where", or "what's our X" about anything project-scoped.
- A hook has injected a `<vault-context>` block into the conversation — that block is the result of a proactive search; treat it as presented context, not a reference dump.
- None of the other mode skills (`research-mode`, `outage-silence`) have fired.

## What vault-first mode changes about your behavior

### 1. Look at injected context first

If the conversation contains a `<vault-context>` block (from `SessionStart` preload or `UserPromptSubmit` search-on-prompt), read the listed note paths and snippets before you do anything else. The hook already did a hybrid search for you — the top hits are sitting in front of you. Do not re-run the same search.

If the injected context is enough to answer, answer from it and cite the note paths.

### 2. If injected context is thin or missing, search the vault yourself

Call `mcp__semantic-vault__search_hybrid` (or `search_text` for exact-match needs) with the user's question as the query. Read 2–3 promising hits in full via `mcp__semantic-vault__read_note` before answering. Do not answer from snippets alone — snippets lose context and produce confidently wrong answers.

### 3. Cite, or say "not in vault" — **only when the prompt is actually a vault lookup**

Read this carefully: the cite-or-deflect rule applies **only when the user asked a project-scoped prose question that a filed note could plausibly answer**. That's the narrow case. For everything else, **ignore the `<vault-context>` block silently** — the hook injects it unconditionally, but the rule does not.

**DO cite-or-deflect when:**
- User asks "how does X work here?", "what's our process for Y?", "where does Z live?", "why is this structured this way?"
- User asks an operational runbook / troubleshooting / gotcha question
- User asks a decision-history question ("why did we choose X?")

**DO NOT narrate "not in vault" when:**
- The user's prompt is a **meta-question about the tool** ("is semantic-vault the same as semantic-sidekick?", "should I install this somewhere?", "what command do I run?")
- The user is **debugging the plugin itself** ("/mcp shows only one server", "getting ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND")
- The user asks a **yes/no or status check** ("did that work?", "are you stuck?", "should I restart?")
- The user is **giving a directive** ("proceed", "fix it", "merge the PR")
- The user is asking about **Claude Code** itself, or about your capabilities generally
- The prompt is **conversational/social** ("thanks", "ok", "got it")

In all the "DO NOT" cases: the `<vault-context>` block is injected automatically by the UserPromptSubmit hook but is not relevant. Pretend it isn't there. Answer the user's actual question directly. Do not open your response with any variant of "not in vault" — that is noise, not honest deflection.

The cue for applying cite-or-deflect is the *shape of the user's question*, not the presence of a `<vault-context>` block.

**When you DO apply cite-or-deflect:**
- **Cite:** "…per `runbooks/deploy-staging.md` and `decisions/2026-03-auth-migration.md`." List the paths so the user can open them.
- **Deflect:** "This isn't in the vault. Nearest matches were `X.md` and `Y.md` but neither covers Z. Want me to [search the web / ask more / file a stub note]?"

Do not silently pivot to web search, do not guess from training data, and do not say "the vault has something like this" without naming files. If you haven't named a file, you haven't cited.

### 4. Offer to capture when you fill a gap

If you had to answer from outside the vault (web search, training knowledge, the user telling you something new), offer once to file a note: *"Worth capturing this in the vault as `gotchas/foo.md`?"* — then let the user decide. This is the ingest loop's entry point; don't force it, but don't skip it.

## Boundary conditions — when vault-first does NOT fire

- **Code-symbol lookups.** "Where is `parseAuth` defined?" → `Grep`. "Show me the `User` model." → `Glob`. If the answer is a file + line, the vault is the wrong tool.
- **Pure external research.** "What's the best vector DB for <100k docs?" → `semantic-first`'s Flow B (research vault + web).
- **Active incidents.** If the user mentions "down", "broken", "customers", "rollback", "oncall", an alert timestamp, or pasted error logs, `outage-silence` takes over. Stop auto-firing search. Wait for explicit `/vault` request.
- **Meta-questions about Claude, Claude Code, or this plugin itself.** "How do I use `/clear`?", "is semantic-vault the same as semantic-sidekick?", "should I reinstall?" → these aren't vault lookups. Answer directly, do not narrate "not in vault".
- **Tool/debug/status prompts.** "getting this error…", "did that work?", "are you stuck?", "what command do I run?" → operational meta. Not vault lookups.
- **Directives and conversational turns.** "proceed", "merge please", "thanks", "ok go" → just act/acknowledge. Do not deflect.

## Interaction with hooks

Two hooks participate in this mode:

- **`SessionStart` hook** — runs a hybrid search seeded from cwd and branch, injects the top-K hits as a `<vault-context>` block at session start. You should see it in your context when this skill first activates.
- **`UserPromptSubmit` hook** — runs a keyword search on each user prompt, fingerprinted against recent queries, and injects a `<vault-context>` block if the fingerprint is new. That is why you sometimes see injected hits and sometimes don't — the hook deliberately suppresses re-firing for near-identical prompts.

If you see `<vault-context source="sessionstart">` or `<vault-context source="prompt">` in your context, those are hook outputs. Treat them as the vault speaking first.

## What success looks like

- User asks "how do we handle MFA enforcement?" with no `vault-first` prior mention — you read the injected `<vault-context>` block, pull `features/authentication/mfa-enforcement-overview.md`, answer with citation. Tool budget: 1 read.
- User asks a project question where the hook injected nothing — you run `search_hybrid` yourself, read 2 hits, answer + cite. Tool budget: 2 reads + 1 search.
- User asks something genuinely not in the vault — you say "not in vault", name the nearest misses, offer to capture after the user gives you the answer.
- `outage-silence` fires — you go quiet on the vault, no proactive search, wait for `/vault`.

## What failure looks like

- Ignoring the `<vault-context>` block and running a fresh search anyway — wastes the preload work.
- Answering project questions from training data without citing the vault.
- Saying "the docs cover this" without naming the file.
- Silently falling back to `Grep` when the project question has an obvious prose answer in the vault.
- Firing vault-first during an outage and drowning the user in search context when they need terse operational help.
- **Opening responses with "not in vault" on non-lookup prompts** (meta-questions, debugging, directives, status checks). The `<vault-context>` block fires on every prompt because the hook is unconditional; the skill is the filter. If the prompt isn't a lookup, silently ignore the injected context. "Not in vault" should only appear when the user *asked* something and the vault *didn't answer it*.
