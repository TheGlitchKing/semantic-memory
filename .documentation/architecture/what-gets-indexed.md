# What gets indexed where and why

Companion to [indices-and-storage.md](./indices-and-storage.md). That doc is **storage-perspective** — for each file on disk, what's in it. This doc is **content-perspective** — for each kind of content, where it ends up and which tools surface it.

If you're asking "is X searchable?" or "why isn't this note showing up?", read this.

## Indexing scope: what lives inside the vault

The indexer walks **only** the directory passed via `--notes`. `src/core/indexer.ts:30`:

```ts
const files = await glob("**/*.md", { cwd: this.notesPath, follow: true });
```

That single line is the source of truth for "what gets indexed." Everything follows from it:

- ✅ **Files inside `<vault>` ending in `.md`** → indexed
- ✅ **Files in subdirectories of `<vault>`** → indexed (recursive glob)
- ✅ **Symlinked files** → indexed (`follow: true`)
- ❌ **Files outside `<vault>`** → not indexed (e.g. `.planning/`, `node_modules/`, source code, anything in your project root unless your project root IS the vault)
- ❌ **Files NOT ending in `.md`** → not indexed (no `.txt`, `.org`, `.rst`, `.pdf`, `.json`, `.yaml`, etc.)
- ❌ **Files inside `<vault>/.semantic-sidekick-index/`** → not indexed (excluded by lint glob; would create circular reference if included)
- ❌ **`<vault>/vault.schema.yml`** → not indexed by the search indexer (it's the schema definition, read separately by `lintVault`)

If your file isn't `*.md` inside `<vault>`, it does not exist as far as `search_*` tools are concerned.

## What semantic-memory does with each `.md` file

For every markdown file the indexer finds, it extracts and indexes multiple distinct kinds of content:

| Content extracted | Where it goes | Which tools surface it |
|---|---|---|
| **Title** (from frontmatter `title` field, or first H1, or filename) | `docs.cache.json` (per-doc), `graph.json` (graph node label) | `list_notes` (returns title field), `search_*` (results are scored against full-text search-text only includes title in match scope) |
| **Body text — chunked** | Each chunk → vector via embedder → `embeddings.json` + `hnsw.bin` + `hnsw-meta.json` | `search_semantic`, `search_hybrid` |
| **Body text — raw** | `docs.cache.json` (per-chunk text array, kept verbatim for snippet rendering) | `search_text` (regex/keyword over chunks), `read_note`, `read_multiple_notes`, `list_notes` |
| **Frontmatter (YAML)** | Parsed into `IndexedDocument` fields (status, tier, domains, tags, last_verified, sources, derived_from, load_priority, purpose, etc.) | `list_notes` (filters by status/tier/domain), `search_*` (filters by status/tier/domain), `get_frontmatter`, `find_schema_violations`/`lint_vault({checks:["schema"]})`, `find_missing_provenance`/`lint_vault({checks:["provenance"]})` |
| **Wikilinks `[[target]]`** | Edges in `graph.json` (out-edges from this note → target notes) | `search_graph`, `search_hybrid` (rerank), `backlinks`, `forwardlinks`, `graph_path`, `graph_statistics`, `find_broken_links`/`lint_vault({checks:["broken_links"]})` |
| **Tags `#tag`** (frontmatter `tags` array AND inline `#tag` markers) | Tag nodes in `graph.json`, edges from notes to tags | `search_graph` (concept matching), `search_hybrid`, `manage_tags({action: "list"})`, `rename_tag` (deprecated), `manage_tags({action: "rename"})` |
| **`related_docs` frontmatter** | Edges in `graph.json` (explicit related-link edges) | `search_graph`, `search_hybrid`, `backlinks`, `forwardlinks` |
| **`load_priority` frontmatter (1-10)** | Stored on `IndexedDocument`; used as score multiplier | `search_semantic`, `search_hybrid` (boosts results +20% / -18% based on priority) |
| **`mtime`** (file modification time) | `docs.cache.json` per-doc; used for date filters | `search_*` (modifiedAfter / modifiedBefore filters), `list_notes` (modifiedAfter / modifiedBefore) |
| **Frontmatter `last_verified`** | Stored on `IndexedDocument` | `find_stale`/`lint_vault({checks:["stale"]})`. **In v1.3+, this drives confidence decay re-ranking in search.** |

## Chunking strategy

Body text is split into chunks before embedding. Each chunk becomes one vector in the index. Splits happen at:

1. **Section boundaries** — markdown `##` and `###` headings
2. **Token-count caps** — chunks too large for the embedding model's context window get split
3. **Code-block respect** — chunks try not to split fenced code blocks

Result: a typical 500-line note produces 3–8 chunks. Each chunk → 384-dim vector → indexed independently.

This is why `search_semantic` returns chunks, not whole notes — the chunk that matched, with its parent note path. Multiple chunks from the same note can appear in results.

## What the graph looks at

`src/core/graph.ts` builds a directed multi-graph:

| Node type | Source | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `note` nodes | One per indexed `.md` file | Vertex for every searchable note |
| `tag` nodes | Created lazily when first encountered | Lets `search_graph` traverse "all notes with tag X" |

| Edge type | Source | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `wikilink` | Each `[[target]]` in body text | Direct authored connection |
| `related_doc` | Each entry in frontmatter `related_docs` array | Explicit cross-reference |
| `tag` | Each tag mentioned (frontmatter or inline) | Concept clustering |
| `derived_from` | Each entry in frontmatter `derived_from` array | Provenance chain (note → source note) |

The graph is **derived** — rebuilt fresh from markdown via `graph.buildFromDocuments()` on every full reindex. The watcher rebuilds incrementally on file changes.

## What the lint pass looks at

`lintVault` (`src/core/lint.ts`) walks the same `**/*.md` glob (with one extra ignore for `vault.schema.yml`) and runs four checks per file:

| Check | What it inspects | Surfaces via |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_violations` | Frontmatter against `vault.schema.yml` rules (required fields, type unions, enum values) | `find_schema_violations` (deprecated) / `lint_vault({checks:["schema"]})` |
| `missing_provenance` | Notes of types `note`/`decision`/`gotcha` that lack BOTH `sources` and `derived_from` | `find_missing_provenance` (deprecated) / `lint_vault({checks:["provenance"]})` |
| `stale` | `last_verified` older than `schema.stale.max_age_days` (default 180) | `find_stale` (deprecated) / `lint_vault({checks:["stale"]})` |
| `broken_links` | `[[wikilinks]]` whose target name doesn't match any known note basename | `find_broken_links` (deprecated) / `lint_vault({checks:["broken_links"]})` |

Lint is read-only — it never modifies notes. Findings appear in:
- The full `lint_vault` report
- `apply_patch` validation (warnings allowed by default; errors block writes when `validate: true`)

## What's indexed but NOT searchable as a single unit

Some content is indexed but only retrievable via specific tools:

| Content | Indexed where | NOT searchable via | Searchable via |
|---|---|---|---|
| `log.md` events | Parsed by `logQuery` on demand; NOT in the vector index | `search_*` does not match log events as such | `log_query({kind, after, before, limit})` — direct structured access |
| `vault.schema.yml` | Read by `loadSchema` on lint runs; NOT in the vector index | `search_*` (excluded from glob) | Direct file read; no MCP tool returns it |
| Auto-generated `index.md` files | Indexed normally as regular markdown notes | Same as any note | `search_*`, `read_note`, `regenerate_index` |
| Frontmatter alone (without body) | Searchable structurally via filters; not embedded as a chunk by itself | Free-text frontmatter content (e.g. `purpose`) is not a separate vector | `list_notes` filter args, `search_*` filter args, `get_frontmatter`, `update_frontmatter` |

## Files explicitly NOT indexed

The lint pass uses this ignore list (`src/core/lint.ts:30`):

```ts
ignore: ["node_modules/**", ".semantic-sidekick-index/**", "vault.schema.yml"]
```

The indexer's glob is the same `**/*.md` but without explicit ignore — it relies on the convention that:

- `node_modules/` rarely contains markdown (and shouldn't be inside a vault)
- `.semantic-sidekick-index/` only contains JSON, no `.md` files
- `vault.schema.yml` doesn't end in `.md` so doesn't match the glob

In practice, the indexer never sees these files because the convention holds. If you put markdown inside `<vault>/.semantic-sidekick-index/` for some reason, it WOULD be indexed (and then the next reindex would re-include the indexed-then-deleted markdown — so don't do that).

## Special files inside the vault

These are vault-managed and behave specially:

| Path pattern | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `<vault>/log.md` | Indexed as a regular markdown note BUT the structured machine-readable YAML blocks inside are also parseable via `log_query` separately. Don't manually edit log.md — use `log_event`. |
| `<vault>/index.md` and `<vault>/<dir>/index.md` | Indexed as regular notes. Auto-regeneratable via `regenerate_index`. Hand-edits are PRESERVED outside auto-regenerated sections. |
| `<vault>/proposals/<date>-<slug>.md` (v1.1+) | Indexed as regular notes BUT `status: proposal` frontmatter signals these are review-pending. Filter them out via `list_notes({status: "active"})` or `search_*({status: "active"})`. Use `synthesize_promote` to move them to canonical destinations. |
| `<vault>/sources/<slug>.md` | Indexed as regular notes. `type: source` from `ingest_source`. Should have `source_uri`, `source_title`, etc. frontmatter. |

## What's outside the vault and therefore invisible

These all live OUTSIDE the vault and are NOT searchable:

| Path | Why not indexed |
|---|---|
| `<project>/.planning/*` | Outside the `--notes` path. Per-developer transient state, gitignored. |
| `<project>/AGENTS.md` | At project root, not in vault. Canonical contract; `inspect_contract` reads it directly. |
| `<project>/CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code's. Not vault content. |
| `<project>/.claude/skills/**` | Skill bundles managed by claude-plugin-runtime. Not vault content. |
| Source code (`src/`, `lib/`, etc.) | Outside vault. Future work: `code` corpus (not yet wired in v1.x). |
| Comments in source code | Same. |
| Git commit messages | Same. |
| Issue tracker content | Same. |

If you want any of these searchable today, you have two options:

1. **Put them inside the vault** — symlink (the indexer follows symlinks) or copy. Trades vault hygiene for searchability.
2. **Run a second MCP server** — `node ./dist/cli/index.js --notes ./.planning --read-only` exposes them via a sibling MCP server. Adds tool-name collisions (clients see two `search_semantic` tools), so use distinct server names in `.mcp.json`.

## Per-corpus future (v1.4+)

The README at v1.0 announced six corpora: `vault`, `code`, `plans`, `docs`, `research`, `project-map`. **Only the `vault` corpus is wired in v1.x.** The plumbing for multi-corpus is conceptual placeholder — the `--corpus` flag doesn't exist, tools aren't conditional on which corpora are active, and there's only one index.

When multi-corpus lands (v1.4 candidate per ROADMAP), each corpus will:
- Have its own indexer config (chunking strategy varies by content type)
- Write to its own index dir (e.g. `<project>/.claude/.semantic-memory/index/vault/`, `index/code/`, ...)
- Register conditional tools (`search_code`, `read_code_symbol`, etc.)
- Cross-reference via the unified knowledge graph

Until then, "the corpus" === "the vault."

## Verifying what's indexed

Two diagnostic tools:

**`get_stats`** — high-level: total notes, total chunks, embedding dimensions, graph density, index state:

```json
{
  "totalNotes": 1247,
  "totalChunks": 4831,
  "totalEmbeddings": 4831,
  "embeddingDimensions": 384,
  "embeddingModel": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
  "embeddingRuntime": "native",
  "graphNodes": 1289,           // notes + tag nodes
  "graphEdges": 7234,
  "indexState": "ready",
  "lastIndexed": "2026-05-09T03:18:14Z"
}
```

**`list_notes`** — exact count of indexed notes; can filter:

```
list_notes()                              → all indexed notes
list_notes({status: "active"})           → all non-deprecated/non-draft
list_notes({domain: "architecture"})     → only domain-tagged
list_notes({modifiedAfter: "2026-01-01"}) → recent
```

If a file is in the vault but doesn't appear in `list_notes`, possibilities:

1. The indexer hasn't seen it yet — the watcher catches it on save, full reindex catches it on next run
2. Its filename doesn't end in `.md` (extensions are case-sensitive too — `.MD` doesn't match)
3. It's actually outside the vault (check what `--notes` points at)
4. Index is `"empty"` or `"loading"` — `get_stats` reveals state
