# Confidence Decay — Operating Guide

Confidence decay (v1.3+) down-weights search results by how long it's been since a note was last *verified*. It runs automatically on `search_semantic` and `search_hybrid`. This guide covers operating it; for the model and rationale see the [v1.3 changelog](../changelog/v1-3-confidence-decay.md).

## The one thing to know

Decay keys on the `last_verified` frontmatter date. That date is set at note creation and by `verify_note` — **ordinary edits do not touch it**. So a note you edit constantly but never re-verify will still decay. When you re-confirm a note is true, call `verify_note` to reset its clock.

## Reading decay state

**In search results.** Any result down-weighted by decay carries a `decay` block:

```json
{ "path": "gotchas/flaky-indexer.md", "score": 0.28,
  "decay": { "multiplier": 0.35, "age_days": 300, "effective_half_life": 180, "reason": "type=gotcha" } }
```

Fresh notes have no block. A low `multiplier` on a note that's still relevant is your signal to re-verify.

**For one note, on demand:**

```bash
semantic-memory decay-trace gotchas/flaky-indexer.md --notes ./.claude/.vault
```

prints `{ type, last_verified, evergreen, multiplier, age_days, effective_half_life, reason }`. This is the fastest way to answer "why is this note ranking low?"

**The active config:**

```bash
semantic-memory decay-config --notes ./.claude/.vault
```

tells you whether decay is on, the per-type half-lives, and whether the config is defaults or a `vault.schema.yml` override.

## Re-verifying a note

When you've re-checked a note and it's still correct:

```
verify_note({ path: "decisions/auth.md" })
```

This stamps `last_verified` to today (content untouched), logs a `verify` event, and returns the new multiplier (≈1.0). The note ranks fresh again. Use this liberally — it is the intended maintenance ritual for a living knowledge base.

## Marking a note evergreen

For notes that stay true for a long time (a glossary entry, a stable convention), add `evergreen: true` to the frontmatter. It pins the note at full weight **while** `last_verified` is within 365 days.

Important: evergreen is not permanent immunity. Once `last_verified` is older than a year, the evergreen claim is treated as expired and the note decays normally — forcing you to re-affirm it with `verify_note`. This keeps "evergreen" honest (an evergreen note referencing an obsolete framework name should not rank forever).

## Tuning

Edit the `decay:` block in `<vault>/vault.schema.yml` (see [configuration-reference](../reference/configuration-reference.md) for the full block):

- **Too aggressive** (useful notes dropping): raise `default_half_life_days` or the per-type value, or raise `floor`.
- **Not aggressive enough** (stale notes still surfacing): lower the relevant half-life.
- **A type should never decay:** set its `per_type` entry to `null` (this is the default for `source`).

Change the config, then re-run a couple of representative searches (or `decay-trace` a known-old note) to confirm the new curve behaves. Ranking changes deserve a soak — tighten half-lives gradually.

## Disabling decay

One line in `vault.schema.yml`:

```yaml
decay:
  enabled: false
```

restores byte-identical pre-v1.3 ranking. Everything else about the vault is unchanged.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| A note isn't decaying at all | No `last_verified`, or it's in the future | Add a `last_verified` date; decay fails open (1.0) without one |
| `decay-trace` says "no last_verified (fail open)" but the note has one | (Pre-1.3.0 only) unquoted YAML date parsed as a non-string | Upgrade to ≥1.3.0 — `normalizeVerifiedDate` handles Date objects |
| A note decays despite `evergreen: true` | `last_verified` is >365 days old (evergreen expired) | `verify_note` it to re-affirm |
| Everything decayed at once after import | Bulk-imported notes share one old `last_verified` | `verify_note` the ones you've confirmed, or raise half-lives |
| Decay isn't applying to keyword search | By design — decay is a semantic signal | It applies to `search_semantic`/`search_hybrid` only, not `search_text`/`search_graph` |
