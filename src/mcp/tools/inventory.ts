/**
 * Canonical inventory of MCP tools shipped by semantic-memory.
 *
 * This is the source of truth for tool naming, description, and deprecation
 * status. The AGENTS.md generator reads this list to render the Tool Surface
 * section. Phase 8 healthcheck cross-references this against the live MCP
 * server registration to detect drift.
 *
 * When you add or remove a tool registration in src/mcp/tools/*.ts, update
 * this list in the same commit. CI/Phase 8 will catch the drift.
